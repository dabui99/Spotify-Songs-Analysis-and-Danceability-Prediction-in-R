● Analyzed the top 2000 songs on Spotify between 1949 and 2019 to determine the lineage of their data elements

The data is from Kaggle. 
● Applied Simple/Multiple Linear, Simple Quadratic, and Time Series Regression to predict the songs’
danceability based on the results of the correlation coefficient table
