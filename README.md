I analyzed the top 2000 songs on Spotify between 1949 and 2019 to determine the lineage of their data elements
(e.g., tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength) and danceability. The data for this project is from Kaggle. I then applied Simple/Multiple Linear, Simple Quadratic, and Time Series Regression to predict the songsâ€™danceability based on the results of the correlation coefficient table.
